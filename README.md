# Word-Guess

<!-- ![Word Guess Cli](WordGuess.gif) -->

Hangman style CLI game. 

What works...
 - random word generated for each game. 
 - Word object linked to Letter object
 - inquirer prompts asking user to 'Guess a letter'
 - letter function that checks if user guess matches game word

What doesn't work...
 - letters do not save from round to round
 - cannot figure out how to have console display letters and _ for word in one line.
